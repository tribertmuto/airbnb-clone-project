# Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying and documenting design properties such as color schemes and typography is essential for consistency, scalability, and usability in UI/UX design. These elements ensure visual harmony across screens and help developers, designers, and stakeholders align on a unified style guide. Mockups act as a single source of truth for how a product should look and feel, reducing ambiguity and enhancing collaboration between cross-functional teams. By defining design properties early, the design process becomes more efficient, and the end-user experience is more cohesive and intentional.
